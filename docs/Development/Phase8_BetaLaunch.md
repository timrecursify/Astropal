## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Preparation
```bash
# Set production environment
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="production-account-id"
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="production-token"

# Verify all secrets are set
./scripts/verify-secrets.sh production
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Run production migrations
wrangler d1 migrations apply astropal_main --env production

# Verify schema
wrangler d1 execute astropal_main --env production \
  --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
```

### 3. Deploy Workers
```bash
# Deploy all workers to production
npm run deploy:production

# Verify deployment
curl https://api.astropal.com/healthz
```

### 4. Upload Assets
```bash
# Upload MJML templates to R2
./scripts/upload-templates.sh production

# Upload locale data to KV
./scripts/upload-locales.sh production
```

## Beta User Setup

### Test User Configuration
```typescript
// Beta test users (hardcoded for initial testing)
const BETA_USERS = [
  {
    email: "timvvoss@icloud.com",
    perspective: "calm",
    focusAreas: ["wellness", "spiritual"],
    locale: "en-US"
  },
  {
    email: "tim@synthetic.jp",
    perspective: "knowledge",
    focusAreas: ["evidence-based", "career"],
    locale: "en-US"
  },
  {
    email: "tim@voss-intelligence.com",
    perspective: "success",
    focusAreas: ["career", "social"],
    locale: "en-US"
  },
  {
    email: "tim@reshoringhq.com",
    perspective: "evidence",
    focusAreas: ["evidence-based", "wellness"],
    locale: "en-US"
  }
];
```

### Onboarding Process
1. User visits https://astropal.com
2. Completes registration with birth data
3. Receives welcome email with auth token
4. Daily content generation begins
5. Monitor delivery and engagement

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics Dashboard
```typescript
// Real-time metrics to monitor
const LAUNCH_METRICS = {
  // User metrics
  "user.registrations": { target: 4, alert: "<4" },
  "user.active.daily": { target: 4, alert: "<3" },
  
  // Email metrics
  "email.delivery.rate": { target: 0.98, alert: "<0.95" },
  "email.open.rate": { target: 0.40, alert: "<0.20" },
  
  // System metrics
  "api.error.rate": { target: 0.01, alert: ">0.05" },
  "api.response.p95": { target: 300, alert: ">500" },
  
  // Cost metrics
  "cost.daily.total": { target: 5, alert: ">10" },
  "llm.tokens.daily": { target: 10000, alert: ">20000" }
};
```

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Beta User Registration Failed"
    condition: "user.registrations < 4 after 1 hour"
    severity: "high"
    action: "Check registration logs"
    
  - name: "Content Generation Failed"
    condition: "content.generation.failures > 0"
    severity: "critical"
    action: "Check LLM API status"
    
  - name: "Email Delivery Issues"
    condition: "email.delivery.rate < 0.95"
    severity: "high"
    action: "Check Resend status"
```

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
- **P1 (Critical)**: System down, no emails sent
- **P2 (High)**: Degraded service, partial failures
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor issues, cosmetic bugs
- **P4 (Low)**: Enhancement requests

### Response Procedures
```typescript
// Incident response workflow
const handleIncident = async (incident: Incident) => {
  // 1. Acknowledge
  await notifyTeam(incident);
  
  // 2. Assess
  const impact = await assessImpact(incident);
  
  // 3. Mitigate
  if (impact.severity === 'P1') {
    await activateFailover();
  }
  
  // 4. Communicate
  await updateStatusPage(incident);
  await notifyAffectedUsers(impact.users);
  
  // 5. Resolve
  await implementFix(incident);
  
  // 6. Review
  await schedulePostMortem(incident);
};
```

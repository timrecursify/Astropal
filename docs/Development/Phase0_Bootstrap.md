## Configuration Files

### Root `package.json`
```json
{
  "name": "astropal",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run dev --workspaces",
    "build": "npm run build --workspaces",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

### Backend `wrangler.toml` Template
```toml
name = "astropal-api"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.production]
name = "astropal-api"
vars = { LOG_LEVEL = "warn" }

[env.development]
name = "astropal-api-dev"
vars = { LOG_LEVEL = "debug" }
```

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- [ ] ESLint passes with no violations
- [ ] Logger utility matches .cursorrules specifications
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully on test commit
